This repository holds the specification of NODE Collective's format for publishing electrification incentives, and supporting documentation.

Please see [SPECIFICATION.md](SPECIFICATION.md) for the spec itself.

NODE Collective welcomes feedback and suggestions for our project. To get started with contributing, you will need to [create a Github account](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github) if you do not already have one. It’s free to do. 

Once you have created an account, you are ready to get involved. NODE Collective has two ways for you to provide feedback to us: Issues and Discussions.

### Issues
Think of Issues like bug reports, or issues that need to be fixed. An example would be “there is a misspelling here” or “the specification does not have an incentive type for cool roofs”. They are specific, actionable items that could be addressed by community members. Issues will be “Closed” when they are completed, and can also be assigned to individuals who will work on them, so there is a complete audit trail of who created an issue as well as who fixed it.

To create a new Issue, make sure you are on the Issues tab. Click the green button and a new entry form will appear.

In the new form, give your Issue a descriptive **Title** so others can tell at a glance what the issue is. In the Description field, you can provide markdown, formatting, links, images, and text. This will allow you to be as descriptive as possible about the issue, so that others can understand easily. Once you have provided enough information, click **Submit new issue**.

### Discussions
This area is meant to be a way to discuss broader questions, such as “I’m not sure how incentive program ABC would be represented in the NODE schema, can anyone help?” and community members can provide guidance.

During the discussion, it is certainly possible to determine that maybe a change to the schema would be necessary to accommodate that incentive. In that case, the change needed would become an **Issue**.

If you are ever not sure where to ask a question, starting with **Discussions** is your best bet.
